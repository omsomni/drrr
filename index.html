<section id="burns" class="burns">
    <h1>BURNS</h1>
    <p>
        Burns can be classified in different various types. These degrees depend on how deeply and severely they damaged the skin's surface.
        <br> There are 3 degrees of burn: First-degree, Second-degree, Third-degree.
        <br> A person may classify a burn immediately when it happens, but it will not be reliable.
        <br> It needs to be medically examined in order to see how the burn affected the person's skin.
        <br> It can also progress overtime, so it may not be the same as before.
    </p>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="burn-col-1">
            <h3>FIRST-DEGREE BURN</h3>
            <p> First-degree burns usually affect only the outer layer of the skin. which is the epidermis. The burn site is red, painful, dry and has no blisters. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="burn-col-2">
            <h3>SECOND-DEGREE BURN</h3>
            <p> Second-degree burns also involves the epidermis and a part of the lower layer of skin, which is the dermis. The burn site looks red, has blisters, and it can be swollen and painful. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="burn-col-3">
            <h3>THIRD-DEGREE BURN</h3>
            <p> Third-degree burns, like the first and second degrees, it damages the epidermis and dermis. However, third-degree burns destroy them and may go into the innermost layer of the skin, the subcutaneous tissue. The burn site may look white or blackened due to the damage.</p>
